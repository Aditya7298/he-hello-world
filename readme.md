## Title:Roll Numbers and Marks Table

## Scenario:

You are working on a React project where users can dynamically add and update students' roll numbers and their marks in Mathematics to a table. The roll numbers are numeric, and the marks are stored in an object with the roll numbers as keys. However, there's a bug: the marks are not being rendered in the order they are added. Instead, they are automatically being sorted by the roll numbers.

Your task is to identify and fix the bug so that the rows in the table are displayed in the exact order they were added.

## Instructions to reproduce the bug

Run the code below and try adding and updating several students with different roll numbers and marks.
Observe the behavior: Notice that the rows are not appearing in the order you added them.
Identify the bug: Figure out why this issue is occurring.
Fix the issue so that the marks are rendered in the correct order as they are added.
